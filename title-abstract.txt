Title:
Optimizing Facial Expression Recognition Tasks for Children Utilizing CNN Architectures

Abstract:
Detecting psychological disorders in children is a complex undertaking. Chil-
dren’s behavior represents a large and unknown spectrum which can make it
difficult to understand the upbringing of certain behaviors. To achieve this
pre-diagnosis, previous studies have looked at using facial expression models
to assist in detecting emotional responses to specific tasks. However, a pitfall
presented is that these models tend to be trained on adult faces and do not
generalize well when predicting children’s emotional responses. To better ad-
dress this challenge, our study utilizes a diverse array of pre-trained models
that are based on advanced architectures of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and transformers. Specifically, we explore the capabilities of models
such as DeepFace and ResNet (which are CNN-based), alongside Vision Trans-
formers (a transformer-based model), and EfficientNet (another CNN-based
model). These models will be evaluated on the FER-2013 dataset, encom-
passing a wide age range, and the Dartmouth Database of Children’s Faces,
focused exclusively on children. By comparing the performance of these mod-
els across the two datasets using common metrics, we aim to delineate the
differences in predicting emotional responses between children and adults.
